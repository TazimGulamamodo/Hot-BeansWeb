            <p>Hi, I’m John Smith, and I’m currently a Web Developer Trainee at Hot Beans Web Development. I joined the team in March 2024, right after completing my A-levels in Computer Science and Maths. From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by how websites work and how I can bring my own ideas to life on the web. In my role at Hot Beans, I’ve been diving deep into front-end development, working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build interactive and responsive web pages. I’ve also started learning about back-end technologies like Node.js and Express. The best part about working here is that I’m constantly challenged to grow, and I get to apply the concepts I learned at school to real-world projects. One of the projects I’m most proud of is building the front-end for a local business’s website. I’ve gained a lot of confidence and practical experience through mentorship and team collaboration, and I’m excited to continue my journey as a developer!</p>

            <p>Hello, I’m Emily Lee, and I’m a Web Developer Trainee at Hot Beans. I’ve always been interested in tech, and after completing a coding bootcamp in 2023, I decided to join Hot Beans in June 2024 to kickstart my career in web development. During my training, I’ve focused on full-stack development, learning how to build both the front-end and back-end of web applications. I’ve been working with React for building dynamic user interfaces and MongoDB for database management, as well as learning about API integration. I’m also learning best practices for writing clean, maintainable code and debugging. What I love most about my time here is the team-first culture at Hot Beans. Everyone is so supportive, and I’m encouraged to ask questions and experiment. I’ve already contributed to several client projects, and I’m excited about what I’ll learn in the coming months. My goal is to become a well-rounded developer with a strong understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies.</p>

            <p>Hi, I’m Alex Patel, and I’m currently a Web Developer Trainee here at Hot Beans. I started my traineeship in April 2024 after completing my degree in Software Engineering. I’ve always been passionate about creating things, and web development felt like the perfect way to combine my coding skills with creativity. At Hot Beans, I’ve been working with front-end technologies like JavaScript, React, and CSS to build interactive user interfaces, and I’ve been gaining exposure to back-end development using Node.js and Express. One of the most exciting parts of my role has been collaborating with both the design and development teams to create seamless user experiences. The mentors here are incredibly knowledgeable, and I’ve learned so much from their feedback. I’m also getting hands-on experience with version control using Git and learning how to deploy applications. I’m looking forward to building my skills further and transitioning into a full-time role as a web developer.</p>
